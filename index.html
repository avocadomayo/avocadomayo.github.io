    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Public art often serves to remind us of certain, significant eras of the city and symbolizes important themes
        that define the city. We walk by public art unknowingly every day, without knowing what they mean or represent.
        Many of us allow public art to fade into our periphery, and even when a piece speaks to you, you struggle to
        find information about it. In project VanGo, we [<a href="https://thecdm.ca/projects/industry-projects/mykrew"
                                                            target="_blank">team mykrew of Centre for Digital Media</a>]
        aimed to engage Vancouverites with their city through public art, by addressing the problems of discoverability
        and accessibility.</p>

    <img src="img/vango_art_map.jpg" width="800"/>
    <div class="caption">Public artworks in Vancouver.</div>

    <p>When we received VanGo from Microsoft Vancouver, it was a <a
            href="http://desibuzzbc.com/2016/06/20/microsoft-unveils-vango/" target="_blank">fully functional
        prototype</a>. The user chooses an art piece to visit, goes to the site, takes a photo within capture range,
        which unlocks information about the art piece.</p>
    <p>Our initial understanding of the project was that it needed a WOW! factor; sprinkles on an already baked cake to
        make it more engaging. But we quickly realized the experience lacked a target persona and that the existing
        features didn’t work in tandem.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>"VanGo makes discovering public art an exploration for locals and tourists to unlock new art knowledge and
        cultural experiences in Vancouver."</p>
    <p>We chose lay new foundations for VanGo, by redesigning the core experience and transforming its look and feel
        using an user-centred approach. We applied Nir Eyal’s Hook Model to reinvent and gamify the core loop to make it
        a sticky experience, and added new features that complement the essence of VanGo. Due to time constraint - we
        had only 12 weeks - we did not implement all aspects of our envisioned customer journey, notably a navigation
        system that guides the user to an art piece of interest. But as strong believers of user-centered design, we
        carried out extensive user research and testing at every step of the process to make informed design decisions.
        The outcome of this 12-week project is a fully-functional Minimal Viable Product.</p>

    <img src="img/vango_process.png" width="600"/>
    <div class="caption">We applied Agile and user-centered design to get there. We started from scratch: first, a ton
        of background and user research to identify who we’re building for. Then we pooled our coolest ideas and applied
        methods like value-complexity matrices to prioritize and scope our project. In production, we implemented
        features, and tested them at every iteration, until we had the MVP!

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
        In production, I assumed the role of a full-stack Android developer, I have ...
    <ul>
        <li>Created UML diagrams from client source code to map out how the code works. These diagrams helped the
            development team move forward, since the client code base was undocumented.
        </li>
        <li>Integrated data in the back-end using SQLite.</li>
        <li>Communicated asset requirements to artists and collaborated with designers via tools such as Zeplin to
            transform the UI for VanGo.
        </li>
        <li>Collaborated with other developers on the team to combine and integrate code.</li>
        <li>Reviewed and improved other developers’ code.</li>
        <li>Implemented four fully-functional features:</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In pre-production, my role was primarily a UX researcher. I have ...
    <ul>
        <li>Carried out background research to identify user demographics, motivation, replay value, and benefits of
            mobile location-based games such as Pokémon GO and Ingress.
        </li>
        <li>Carried out research into competitors, i.e. existing location-based apps about public art.</li>
        <li>Collected quantitative data in various public spaces to identify a target persona.</li>
        <li>Created conceptual models clearly mapping relationships between key concepts in the envisioned user
            experience to facilitate good design.
        </li>
        <li>Participated in user testing as an observer to gain first-hand understanding of how users interact with
            VanGo and to identify bugs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Challenge: Drawing "Zones"</h3>
    <p>
        Ever play games like GTA or Fallout? Was your chest filled with excitement when you discovered a whole new area
        to explore? We were.
        That's why we divided the map of Vancouver into meaningful <i>zones</i> to encourage users to re-discover the
        city and explore its nooks and corners.
        Zones help break down discovery process into manageable chunks and group artworks together. The real challenge
        came in implementing zones in the Webview version of Bing Maps embedded in VanGo.
    </p>
    <p>
        I drew zones using Google Earth, and used <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson" target="_blank">togeojson</a>
        to convert data into JSON.
        The raw JSON was quite dirty- I wrote a script to process this data, saving hours of production time.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="js">
/**
 * Parses and writes clean JSON into a file.
 * @param {object} json - Object corresponding to dirty JSON.
 */
function cleanJson(json) {
    var clean = [];
    for (var x of obj.features) {
        var coord = [];
        for (i = 0; i < x.geometry.coordinates[0].length; i++) {
            coord.push([x.geometry.coordinates[0][i][1], x.geometry.coordinates[0][i][0]]); // lats and longs
        };
        var name = x.properties.name;
        var shape = {
            "name": name,
            "id": assignGUID(),
            "coordinates": coord,
        };
        clean.push(shape);
    };
    clean = JSON.stringify(clean, null, " ");
    // Write clean data to a JSON file
    writeToFile(pathToSave, clean, null);
}
// ...
        </code></pre>
    <p>The clean JSON is used to create polygons (= zones!) which are overlayed on a Bing Map object.</p>
    <pre><code class="js">
/**
 * Creates a polygon for each shape defined in JSON.
 * @param {object} map - Microsoft.Map object to overlay the polygons.
 * @param {object} json - JSON containing each zone's coordinates.
 */
function drawShapesFromJson(map, json) {
    (json.map(elem => {
        return new Microsoft.Maps.Polygon(elem.coordinates.map(coordinate => {
            return new Microsoft.Maps.Location(coordinate[0], coordinate[1]); // lat and long
        }))
    })).map(shape => { map.entities.push(shape); });
}
// ...
        </code></pre>
    <p>A map of Vancouver showing 40 zones! Pretty, eh?</p>

    <h2>Web app prototype | 2016 | UX Designer</h2>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p class="space_after">Degree Navigator is an existing degree audit interface at University of British Columbia
        intended to help students track and plan their degree. Like many university websites, it was dated and difficult
        to navigate. Information needed for degree planning was structured per institutional organization, rather than
        how students planned their courses to fulfill their graduation requirements. Students were prone to overlook
        required courses, which often delayed their graduation.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p class="space_after">I collaborated with a team of HCI students from UBC to user test the current interface and
        identify student needs in degree planning. We designed a proof-of-concept that centralized information to create
        a seamless, efficient degree-planning experience. In this interactive prototype, students can browse courses and
        see how credits would fit into their degrees, all in one place.</p>
    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <p>Encapsulation of our target user. Based on user research, it highlights users' current behaviour, their goals and
        expectations, and pain points in the current interface. Features were created and prioritized according to the
        persona's needs.</p>
    <img src="img/degnav_persona.png" class="space_after" width="750"/>
    <h3>Style Guide</h3>
    <p>I created a modern look to the interface, and sampled colours from the university website to maintain
        consistency.</p>
